Implementation: I believe that every aspect of this asignment have been 
                completed correctly. 

Collaborator: I discussed some of the different scans with Arundeep Singh

Time spent: 10 hours

Dependencies: base64

Is the incident detection good?
    All the detection tecniques I used seem extraordinarily arbitrary. 
    I recognize that these scans (such as nikto) have practices that they 
    keep to, and we can pick up on those different patterns, but nothing is 
    changing the scanners from changing those scans. It's almost as if someone
    is sneaking into your house and they always leave the TV on. You realize
    this, and know when they come into your house... that is until they 
    decide to leave the TV off.

What would I add? 
    If I had more time on this lab, I would try to research these scans more
    and make the scans more robust (rather than arbitrary).
